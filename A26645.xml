            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But though at preſent I be fully ſatisfied, yet I do ſubmit theſe things to the further enquiry of Time and Judicious Ones. I never had any Obligments upon me from her Self, Friends or Favourites; all I appear for, is the Truth, as far as I know it. In this Diſcourſe I must confeſs I did ſwim against the stream of my own Inclinations, Time, Employment; Studies and Reading, skill in the criticiſm of Nature, or Anatomy, and the Mystical Structure of the Houſe of Clay, is really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous unto me. Theſe Papers for any thing I know, may not only be crude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted, but alſo guilty of ſupervacaneous Repetitions, becauſe of their haſt Birth; and then I never ſaw them together, after the two firſt ſheets, till they appeared in publick view, being carried away as faſt as they were writ by the unwearied Sollicitations of an eſteemed Friend. The Sections and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs are not ſo much for Method, as for
<pb facs="tcp:49718:5"/>
convenient Pauſes, or breathing Places, to the Reader. You may think that I have made <hi>Martha Taylor,</hi> as to her pious Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, an excellent Creature, and ſo ſhe was to me, and hundreds of other Viſiters; but if the Waters have not at all times run ſo high and clear, you muſt ſuppoſe this Life has no perfection in it, as long as we dwell in corrupted fleſh, hedged round about with Senſe and various enſnaring Objects.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Martha Taylor</hi> be yet in the Land of the Living, as its ſuppos'd ſhe is, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire theſe ſheets may put her on forward to ſhine forth in an humble holy Profeſſion, that ſhe do not blemiſh her former ſelf, nor diſgrace that happy and fair Appearance which once ſhe made; for if ſhe do, here will be an abiding Monument ſet up againſt her.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Mind of Infinite Wiſdome in the firſt making of the World, was that Humane Bodies ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the uſe of Creatures; this was the reaſon that the great Architect did in ſuch a copious manner provide all convenient neceſſaries for the ſupply of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in the State of Innocency; there was a full Table ready furniſhed for him, that he might upon his firſt approach into life, and his ſtately Dwelling, ſee the way how to maintain himſelf there. The firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is a very ample diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this: God tells him he had not only made the inferour Creatures for his Dominion, Solace, and Advantage, but alſo for meat to live upon, in the 29, and 30. <hi>Verſes;</hi> nay, he gives him a command to uſe them for that end, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. Yet, though it be thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary diſpenſation of Heaven, it cannot be deny'd, but that God is an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Agent, he muſt not be always bound up to one Method in the Actings of his Providence,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49718:6"/>
He onely can do what he pleaſeth, and which way he pleaſeth: <hi>Many things ſeem impoſſible with Men, but with God all things are poſſible,</hi> Mat. 19.26. That our poor, frail, dying, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhould be preſerved alive for forty days together, without the ordinary uſe of creature props, ſeems to us an impoſſibility, yet with God 'tis poſſible. There are many vaſt Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Operations of Divine Providence, that now and then make their appearance in this nether Region, concerning which the moſt knowing man are at a great loſſe, and far to ſeek; of which they may ſpeak in the language of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> That when they think to know theſe, they are too painful for them; or as the Margent reads it from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> they are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in their eyes, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt,</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties on every ſide, too hard for them to overcome.</p>
                  <p>Now the moſt are ready to hiſs every thing off the Stage of the World, which doth not fall within their own cognizance or experience: All things that are ſtrange they reduce preſently to their own ken, and try them by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and former knowledge, to which if theſe wonders do not bear a very fair correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then away with them, they are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown over board for Impoſters. But if theſe men had weighed them in another, far truer Ballance, the Almighty Power of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working God, then its likely they might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49718:6"/>
have found a due weigh in this Coyn, which would have put them upon a further and better ſearch, as to ſee whoſe ſuperſcription was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon it, and what was its innate truth and worth. I muſt confeſs, there is a miſcarriage on both hands, I dare not commend an eaſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, nor an obſtinate unbelief, in the concern of the ſtupendious productions of Nature, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing, and to believe nothing, as they are oppoſites, ſo they are equal extreams and abſurdities; as the one degrades the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Truths, ſo the other advanceth the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational falſhoods: The one hath low thoughts of the moſt ſacred Verity, becauſe there are many things in it, which are higher then the reach of ſenſe and carnal reaſon; the other hath a very great eſteem for a meer Legend of lyes, becauſe it is full of ſeeming wonders. In things which fall within the limits of nature, there's no queſtion but the moſt prudent rational way is to ſtrike a middle ſtroake, between the two dangerous extreames of unadvis'd credulity, and ſenſleſs incredulity. There are ſeveral <hi>Magnalia</hi> or Wonderments of Art and Nature found out within theſe two or three laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, which our moſt inquiſitive Progenitors did not ſo much as dream on: Had ſome diving Head-pieces but run the venter in thoſe times to have whiſpered forth, by a probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the hidden world in <hi>America,</hi> the amazing Nature of the Load-ſtone, the profitable Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49718:7"/>
of Printing, or the like, thoſe ingenious ones its very likely had got no more credence, then we uſe to give, though upon better grounds, to them who now tell us of a world in the Moon. The rational Biſhop <hi>Virgilius</hi> was in the year of Chriſt 745. condemned by Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> for an Heretick, becauſe he aſſerted, and ſtood to it, that there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> which was a thing generally decry'd by the learning of that Age to be a fable, a fond, and a fooliſh thing; of this humour were <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Lucretius,</hi> as <hi>Alſtead</hi> tells you in his <hi>Geography c.</hi> 7. <hi>reg.</hi> 4.

You ſee by this time, that 'tis not the wiſe-mans part to diſcredit every thing that my lye beyond the limits of his own preſent Apprehenſions, but rather to do what he can to climb over the difficulty, and then he will ſee not only the probability and reallity, but alſo the rarity of the thing: Thus do you in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Story, which I do not queſtion hath as much of Truth, as Strangeneſs in it</p>

                  <p n="1">1. HEr Fathers name is <hi>William Taylor,</hi> one who is Originally, and as to his preſent ſtate or degree, a plain Country-man, whoſe employment lyes in the Lead Mines: He hath no more eaſie way to advance a livelihood, then that which was of Divine determination, by the ſweat of his Brow: A man of no larger Politicks, then how to get an homely, honeſt maintenance for him and his; he has ſo much of Religion in him as to keep free from Lying, Looſneſs, or the Debauchery of the Age, and to have a good eſteem for holy things. The Man is of good Credit amongſt the better ſort of Neighbours. His Wife was of ſomthing an higher Rank then himſelf, both as to Birth and Education; A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in her common carriage very careful, and cautious about her words and actions; I am ready to ſuppoſe, in the judgement of charity, upon ſome trial of her, that ſhe hath a taſt of thoſe good things which refer to another world. This couple hath lived many years together, had ſeveral Children, and among the reſt this <hi>Martha,</hi> which is the occaſion of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Place of her Dwelling is <hi>Over-Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſo called as I conjecture from its being high,

and looking over <hi>Haddon-hall,</hi> from which fair Houſe of the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> it is about a mile diſtant, as ſuch from <hi>Bakewell</hi> a conſiderable Market-Town, in the High Peak in <hi>Derbyſhire;</hi> The Houſe they dwell in is but an ordinary Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, yet not ſo little but there is room enough for God to do great things in; Wonders have been brought forth in a Stable or a Manger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now; tis not the highneſs of the place that ſhould make us turn our eyes towards it, but the greatneſs of the work that may be done there. But now to her that lies in it.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Beginning and Progreſs of her Afflictions, and what they were.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Am ready to ſuppoſe, that the Fountain-Head of all her Afflictions was her lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which took its beginning in the year 1661. which is now about eight years ago, by the unhappy ſtroke of a Miller her next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, over the Hips or ſmall of the Back: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did it in jeſt or earneſt I cannot certainly determine, but I think the latter was affirmed to me; however the occaſion was no offence given on her ſide, ſhe was ſo happy as to be harmleſs, her Innocence in this caſe might be a good piece of a Pillar for her to lean her ſelf upon, when wearied under that great weight of Afflictions, which was bound faſt unto her. Poor <hi>Martha,</hi> upon this fatal ſtroke, was taken with a lameneſs in the lower parts, indiſpoſing them for their proper uſe; which was followed at the heels with a general indiſpoſition and incompoſure of the whole inward and o tward frame; for her diſtempers did ſo croud in upon her, that ſhe was ſuddenly compell'd to lay down the whole Body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49718:9"/>
as an uſeleſs lump; to which condition ſhe hath been confined ever ſince; onely once or twice about <hi>April</hi> 1662. for ſome few days, ſhe made a ſhift to go abroad: But upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May</hi> in the ſaid Year 1662. ſhe bid farewell to the open, refreſhing Air, and then entred cloſe Priſoner to her tedious Bed. From which place, ſince that time, ſhe hath never moved, without the help of other hands and feet beſides her own; where I ſuppoſe ſhe is like to lye till Death bring her an <hi>Habeas-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> and make her free among the dead; in which eſtate only the weary be at reſt, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Diſeaſes ceaſe from troubling.</p>
                  <p>All along this tract of time, ſhe hath been troubled with other infirmities beſides lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as private bleeding, often ſick, and ſeldome free from leſs or more of a Feaver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to make a neerer approach to the time of her conſtrained Faſt; you muſt know that there were many Afflictions gathered together to bring about the thing; though ſhe had for four or five years together by times lain under various Diſtempers, yet about the cloſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and beginning of the following Month, in the Year 1667. they combine together into a body, and add others to their number, that they might the more vigorouſly produce the ſtrange enſuing Effects. For in the entrance of <hi>November,</hi> in the mention'd Year, did begin her ſtrange and wonderful Bleedings at ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49718:9"/>
Parts, as at the Mouth, the Noſe, the Ear, the Eye, from which laſt part did continually diſtill perfect Tears of blood, ſo that one would have thought Life would have Wept it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out at the Eye. One very probable cauſe of this her admir'd Bleeding, might ariſe from her violent continued Vomiting, which broke open convenient Paſſages, through which the Blood might vent it ſelf; 'tis an ordinary known caſe, that the over-ſtraining of the Body does break the Veins, and ſo leſs or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth an Efflux of Blood from ſome or other parts. This extraordinary Vomiting continued all along <hi>November,</hi> ſo that ſhe neither took in meat nor drink, but preſently threw it up again, nothing could be perſwaded to abide within her Stomack. This ſtrong Vomiting did ariſe (as I conjecture) from thoſe Corrupt Crudities, Nauſeating Vapours, and Filthy Humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by her long lying in Bed, and the want of convenient Exerciſe, which did weaken and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the natural Attractive, Retentive, and Concoctive Faculties, and ſtir up the Stomach againſt every thing that was ſent down into it. This preternatural Vomiting did further intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a very ſtrange Hiccough, audible many paces from the houſe, which would move her whole Body, and pluck down her Head with great torment: To which was adjoyned a ſort of Convulſions, or the often Diſtortion of her Joynts by the Cramp: So that now Cramps,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49718:10"/>
Convulſions, Strange ſighings, and the Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, (all of them the Genuine Off-ſpring of a diſordered Stomack, and continued violent Vomiting) were all in open War againſt the Eaſe and Life of this poor tormented Creature. Theſe things had made her the real wonder of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Sympathizing Spectators; to ſee a poor Fellow-creature almoſt conſtantly upon the Rack, under the moſt Exquiſite Pains, Burnings, Cramps, Vomitings, and the moſt ſtrange Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Hiccoughs, that ever I read or heard of. Now theſe all laid together, by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the enſuing <hi>December,</hi> had neer upon reduced the <hi>Microcoſme</hi> into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly taken Nature off the hinges, and well neer ſhattered into pieces, a poor, frail dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body; ſo that for certain, her more Noble Immortal Part, had then bid farewel to its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houſe of Clay, had not Divine Providence ſtept in, and put under an everlaſting Arm.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe Diſtempers prevail ſo far, as for a Fort-night together within <hi>December,</hi> they take away the uſe of Speech and Senſes, ſo that ſhe had very little to witneſs ſhe was alive, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome remaining heat and breath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. About the middle of this Month ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives a little, gets ſomething of the exerciſe of Senſe and Speech; but ſtill hath that violent Hiccough, and frequent ſick fits: As ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived neither meat nor drink for this fourteen days, ſo now being come to her ſelf ſhe finds an

                     </gap>y approach of Meat or Drink was a great trouble to her, the very ſight or ſmell of either, though at a remove, would beget her ſorrow; yea, the very thoughts of either would make her ſick before hand. She found now ſo much eaſe and ſatisfaction in the abſtaining from the uſe or thoughts of any Food, that now ſhe lays down the firſt fixed Determinations to have to do with neither come Life or Death. This makes her give her ſelf over into the Hands of an Almighty Power, and there to reſt ſatisfied, hoping and expecting to be upheld in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way by immediate ſupport, or elſe to be tranſported to that place where none of theſe things were neceſſary: Seeing the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtreams would not run, ſhe reſolves to be contented without them, till ſhe could aſcend to the Fount in-head. No queſtion but we may expect, hope, and pray to be enabled to live without the uſe of means, when the Great Lord of the Univerſe denies the enjoyment of it. That holy Man in our Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days (of whom Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)</hi> who through the inhumanity of his barbarous Perſecutors, was deni'd any thing at all to live upon, believes and prays, <hi>That God would either find Meat, or take away the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and enable him to live without it,</hi> was to a wonder anſwered in the latter of his Petitions, ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49718:11"/>
that he ſubſiſted to his Martyrdom with great de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ight, without the thoughts of Meat or Drink, or the ſenſe of any need of either. As I hinted in the <hi>Introduction,</hi> ſo I ſay again, That Infinite Wiſdome and Power hath done many ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions, without the uſe of means. That God which Created the World, without any pre-exiſtent matter to work upon, can when it pleaſeth him, ſupport and under-prop it, or any of its Inhabitants, without borrowing the aid of any Sublunary Means, Second Cauſe, or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Help.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet, to come to my main buſineſs, I muſt tell you, That this poor afflicted Maid, being (as I told you) troubled with a Feavoriſh heat upon her, did ſometimes deſire a drop of Wine, or Milk, or Water, in which Prunes had been laid, or for the moſt part ſimple Water to cool her Lips withal; but then ſhe received it with the greateſt ſtruggling, and ſelf-counteſt that ever I ſaw in my life; as if ſo be it had been ſomething which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The bringing neer her a little Water in a Spoon would make her very ſick, and awaken her vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hiccough, ſo that ſhe for the moſt part was forced to ſtrive-long with her ſelf before ſhe could receive the Water to her Lips; which ſhe made ſo ſmall uſe of, that when the Spoon was brought away again, the moſt Critical Eye could perceive little or nothing wanting. I am perſwaded, that the refreſhing coolneſs which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49718:11"/>
the Senſes then made uſe of, did enjoy from the Water in the Spoon, were ſufficient ſatisfaction without letting any of it down into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, for coolneſs and refreſhing ſmells were very delightſome to her; as is abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd by her living many Weeks together without touching any thing with her Lips, only ſhe had Spring-water, or Green-herbs, or Freſh-flowers, held or laid at a diſtance from her, for nigh her ſhe could not admit them, <hi>They being</hi> (as her ſelf would language it) <hi>too ſtrong for her Brain.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. At this rate ſhe hath liv'd for about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months together: only once in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe ſucked ſome ſmall quantity of a Baked Apple; and it may be, ſome very few times ſhe hath taken an inconſiderable bit of Sugar, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Peaſe; and ſince the cloſe of the laſt Year, inſtead of a ſmall drop or two of liquids, in the ſpace ſometimes of one, two, or more days, ſhe hath delighted her taſt by the ſucking of a Raiſin, Prune, or Fig, one of which will laſt her a long while together; and when when ſhe has done with it, all the Pulp is left behind: Once, I confeſs, out of curioſity, or a deſire to eat if poſſible, ſhe did ſwallow down part of a Fig, but had like to have dyed for the ſpace of twenty four hours after it, till by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting ſhe threw it up again. This might be, either becauſe of the loſs of the Concoctive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and the Offenſive Humors in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49718:12"/>
or becauſe the common Paſſages by which Nature ſhould convey ſuch things through the body are removed and diſplaced. There hath long lain behind and before, ſomething fallen out of the Body; which ſome noted Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Phyſick and Chyrurgery, ſeveral judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women, and at leaſt two approved, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Mid-wives, do really judge and aſſert to be the Bowels or Guts behind, and the Bladder and Matrix before. Now, 'tis no wonder that ſuch great and continued weakneſs ſhould bring down theſe, for it has often been known in the like caſe. Theſe ejected or dilapſed inward Parts, did for a long time lye by her dry and conſuming away, and put her to great unknown torments, before her modeſty would permit her to make her caſe known; which afterward was ſomething eaſed by anointing or bathing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now you may ſtand and wonder here, at the way of the preſervation of this poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how ſhe ſhould have been upheld thus long in time, under theſe multitudes of ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſuppoſe here were which I forgot, or never heard of; I ſhall Subjoyn one or two more, to thoſe mentioned above; as, her <hi>Want of Sleep,</hi> when ſhe ſlept moſt, it was but very little, and not ſound, but meer Slumber-like, the uſual time of it was in the Morning, the continuance ſeldome above an Hour or Two. But the ſhe did often live whole Weeks without any ſleep at all, and ſometimes many of theſe Weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as the United Acknowledgment of ſeveral that Waked with her did ſufficiently teſtifie. Further, ſhe was often much afflicted in the weakne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s or loſs of the external Senſes; as, ſometimes Seeing was weak, ſometimes Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was weak; theſe two more Noble Senſes, which do contribute ſo much to the comfort and advantage of the Rational Creature, were often at a low ebb, little or nothing ſerviceable to our afflicted <hi>Martha:</hi> Her Smelling alſo was now and then quite gone: The Vomiting, and the ſtrong Hiccough or Convulſions forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, were beyond all controverſie the ground of this weakneſs, or deficiency of the Senſes, blocking up or blemiſhing their Organs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and their hidden, uſeful, natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or qualities. Thus much with brevity for her External Afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I ſhall now proceed in a word or two to give you a glance at her more Inward Sorrows, which were much comprized under, and cauſed by two things; <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Temptations.</hi> For
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49718:13"/>
the <hi>Reproach,</hi> it was her happineſs they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that name, they might have been far greater ground of trouble if they had been juſt <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations;</hi> but yet at the firſt, ſhe was but too ready to lay theſe heavy to her heart, as you have it ſpoken of one eminently pious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heavineſs.</hi> Who is not ſo tender of a good Name, as that the leaſt blemiſh and aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion caſt upon it, ſeemeth more wounding then the cutting of a Sword? Slander and Calumny looks but too inſufferable, even to good and worthy natures. <hi>The conſtant reproach and ſcoffs of disbelievers did very often add bitterneſs to her wormwood.</hi> Divers ſorts of Perſons there were who employed themſelves to vilifie her, and cry her up for a Cheat, round about the Country: Though the beſt Arguments they enforced their unworthy Reports with, <hi>were only Suſpicion, Conjecture,</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi> what could they otherwiſe riſe from, ſeeing they ſpoke without tryal; they did, <hi>Audabatarum more pugnare,</hi> wink and fight againſt the Truth in her concern. Ignorance of the cauſe, poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or former experiences, concerning things truly admirable, is looked upon by ſome as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon good enough, not only to queſtion them, but alſo to deny their reality. How rational theſe were in <hi>Martha</hi>'s caſe, will be ſhown in third Part of this Treatiſe, to which I refer you. But as theſe were the cauſe of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49718:13"/>
Trouble, ſo alſo were her Temptations. The Devil, the grand Tempter, who conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drives a great Trade this way, took all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to diſturb her peace, to draw her over to his ſide, or at leaſtwiſe to draw her from her God; he ſhewed his malice in doing his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to hinder her from a way of grace; he laid what Remoras his craft could invent to ſtop her in the way to <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST. He would either have her reſt ſatisfi'd in a State of Nature, or contented in the bare external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Practical Duties; or elſe, bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to Religion, to all Hopes of Help from Chriſt, and future Happineſſe in Heaven; or laſtly, run her ſelf upon one of the two deſtructive Rocks of Preſumption or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this Crafty and Unwearied Adverſary <hi>Martha</hi> had about a year ago very ſharp Conteſts; and afterward the like with ſome of his Inſtruments, Heretical Ones, who did their utmoſt to Proſelite her to their Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Conceits. <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Peak <hi>had formerly in it noyſome and hurtful Wolves, whence he ſaith</hi> Worme-hill <hi>had its Name from</hi> Wolf-haunt; <hi>though the care and induſtry of former times hath utterly deſtroyed thoſe Brutes, yet there abide others which deſerve their Name, and are of a more

dangerous Nature.</hi> With theſe <hi>Martha,</hi> under her great diſtreſs, was put to many a tough Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and large and troubleſome Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Her troubles of Body and Mind, were often much aggravated by her being at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from many neceſſary helps: External helps for the Body, ſuch as ſhould allay or mitigate the pains of the afflicted Members and Parts: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps, about Soul concernments, by her ſolitarineſs, her own inquiſitive thoughtfulneſs, about the urgent buſineſs of a dying ſtate, and appearance in another world, her great diſtance from ſound, ſerious, and pious Acquaintance. But in all theſe, ſhe found ſome mitigation, yea, ſome conſiderable eaſe, by caſting Anchor upon Divine goodneſs, and by ſeating down upon ſome or other Shelf of the Rock of Ages. Though ſhe was in her greateſt weakneſs, often at Ebbs and Tydes, ſometimes driven out by Storms upon the bluſtering Waves, ſometimes again ſhor'd upon a convenient Lee-harbour.</p>

This pure Complexion of her Face, was the admiration of all intelligent Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to ſee a frail, brittle Body, under thoſe great Afflictions, and that continued Abſtinence from outward Supplies, look ſo lovely, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, not reduced to Skin and Bone, not at all gaſtly or terrifying, but rather a delightful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, worth the looking on, and taking pleaſure in. Thus ſhe continued for three Quarters of a Year or more together; and for the following Month held the ſame quantity of Fleſh, though I think not altogether ſo fair in the Face.</p>
                  <p>Her Armes alſo all along this tract of time have been well covered over.</p>
                  <p>Her Pulſe pretty ſmooth, even, and lively in its motions; ſeldom diverted out of the uſual courſe, but when ſhe was under ſome immediate ſorrow of Body or Mind.</p>
                  <p>Her Eyes, though often very weak, were ſometimes quick and durable in their beholding or dwelling upon objects, ſo that ſhe would know that ſhe looked upon at the firſt glance, and continue reading for an hour or more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Her Lungs commonly ſhew'd themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay'd by the audibleneſs and continuation of her Diſcourſe: She would, when freed from the troubleſome Hiccough, talk pretty loud and long together.</p>

You might have laid your Fingers betwixt the Ribs, and feel the Belly (thorow double Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen) fallen down from the Breſt to the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, where it lay as flat, as if Nature had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy'd any hollow place betwixt, or any proper Inhabitants in that Dwelling. When you had been ſatisfying your Curioſity by a ſtrict ſearch here, you would have ſuppoſed your Hand to have been examining an half-conſum'd Carkaſs within a Grave. Here alſo modeſt Inquiſition might have ſtood amazed to behold that colour and fleſh on the Face and Armes, and yet find that vaſt decay in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts.</p>
                  <p>The late ſober and ſearching Obſervation of ſome well-skill'd in Anatomy hath told us, that the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Joynts in the Back, are eaſily felt through the Belly by the touch of the Finger: And that her Body is devoid of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or fleſhly Membranes. It may have been long thus with her, but was not known before the cloſe of the laſt year, for want of ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ones to make the Trial.</p>

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49718:15"/>3. She hath ſince the beginning of the year 1668. avoided no Excrements by Stool or Urin; neither hath ſhe had any moiſture in her Mouth or Noſe. She did (I think) at the firſt ſometimes ſweat a little, and ſince had now and then ſome ſmall Pimples or Out-breaks upon the Wriſts of her Armes, which ſome ſuppoſe to be the reſult of thoſe few drops of weak Liquids, which might ſometimes paſſe down into her Stomack; and that the abiding Power of Nature, having no other way left, doth uſe that ſtrong one, to Evacuate her Dregs. Others, again ſay, That as long as there is my remaining blood, which is in her like water in a ſtanding Pool, it will corrupt, and that the corrupted part doth in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Vent it ſelf by the Pores: We all know, as to our own Bodies, that Nature, with very ſmall help, doth by theſe little inſenſible Holes in the Skin, ſend forth thoſe Vapors and Humors which would endanger the Body, if they ſhould take up their lodging within the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The two Senſes of Hearing and Smelling were once (that I ſay not oftner) ſo incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably acute and quick, that ſhe would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and diſtinguiſh their ſeveral Objects at a vaſt remove. A conſiderable Eccleſiaſtick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who did many times viſit her, told me, That for moſt of the time he had taken notice of her, he found ſhe had all her Faculties and ſenſes, excepting that of Seeing, in as great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49718:16"/>
vigour, as he thought it poſſible to be in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorified Body.</p>
                  <p>Our groſs way of feeding doth very much dull and clogg up the Senſes in their exerciſe; we little know the great comfort we ſhould enjoy in them, if we did not ſo much indulge to the irregular Appetite: Temperance or ſobriety, both as to the quantity and quality of what we live upon, would abundantly quicken and put into right motion all the Senſes. 'Tis undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that many Brutes, who are compell'd to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves with a ſpare and thrifty way of feeding, do quite exceed us in Senſe. But, I ſuppoſe, if you take them in their greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, our <hi>Martha</hi> did once out-vie them, and that was in Smelling; not onely that ſhe could take pleaſure in Smells, for in that its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable Man exceeds all other Animals; but ſhe over-did them in the very thing, in which ſome ſay they ſurpaſs Man, which was the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhment out of Odors; for, as I told you in the preceding Section, thus ſhe lived for many Weeks together.</p>

                  <p>THough ſhe may appear eminent in theſe, eſpecially the latter, yet the rariety of them does not lye ſo much in their greatneſs, as the way of their Attainment: She was not Cultivated by Education at home or abroad; the Country where ſhe was Born and Bred, is but too great a ſtranger to Accompliſhments of either Nature. The Inhabitants are more taken up with a ſtrict ſearch about the hidden things of Nature among the Rock and Hills, then they are about thoſe more enriching ones of Reaſon and Religion. Their Hands and Thoughts are ſo much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about that dull and heavy Mineral, which is the ſtanding Traffick of thoſe Parts, that they cannot afford to wear time or pains upon the more refined or ſpiritual Ornament of Body or Mind. The very Breeding of that Country

has been noted for ſomething more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ruſtick: The Religion of very many there is but few degrees beyond ignorance.

Her Deportment, which was very lovely, raiſing up her head in Bed, and bowing her ſelf to all with a ſmiling grateful Countenance, continually giving ſutable terms of Reſpect and Decency. Her Courteſie, her Candour, and Comely Carriage, quite over-acted her original as to place and perſons. She was in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. For Prayer; She was obſerved to be conſtant in it, either in Confeſſing Sin, Begging Mercy, or Praiſing God. She ſeemed to be made up of Prayer when moſt afflicted. The neer approach of the By-ſtanders Ear might be ſatisfi'd in this, That her Voice, when at the weakeſt, would be ſpending it ſelf upon her God, by fervent, pious Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to hold up an heart-chearing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between Heaven and her hungering Soul. For an affectionate Joyner in this great Duty, when I Viſited her, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I never found her Parallel: She ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſenſible, ſerious, ſtruggling, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame of Spirit, to go (as it were) out of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49718:18"/>
her ſelf into an upper Region; ſo that when a rouſing Prayer hath been ended, ſhe would be puzzled to reduce her ſelf, and compoſe the humane frame. Her own perſonal way of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was much concealed, and to her ſelf, was uſually ſhort and ſententions, but very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, comprehenſive, humble, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

Some took much notice of this, as a thing rather ſtrange then contemptible; no queſtion, but 'tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawful Art to advantage good diſcourſe, and pious conference, with powerful taking Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. 'Tis, if I may ſo call it, a ſacred Fraud, every way lawful to ſteal the Ears and Hearts of thoſe with whom we converſe to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate obſervation of the deep concernments of an Eternal and better State. The Sword of Rhetorick in a Wife Mans hand may wound the Champions of Irreligion, and win the Day for Heaven. The applauded wit of the Age, in which we live, doth but too much proſtitute it ſelf to the greateſt Ribaldry. Our <hi>Martha</hi> had the happineſs, to enjoy a conſiderable,

clear, ſmooth Phraſe, not guilty of bombaſt or boyiſh vanity; which for the moſt part ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon the beſt of things. I confeſs her ignorance of other Tongues then what ſhe was born to, did ſometimes in the beginning Months of her afflictions produce ſome ſmall miſtakes of Words and Terms, which afterwards were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to a more acute and regular way of ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the manner of her Speech was not worth the taking notice of, if you compare it with the matter of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Her ordinary ſayings were very conſiderable; with which I queſtion not but I by my own, or friends Collections, might have Stuft more Sheets, then at this time I muſt have leave to Beſtow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon Her Story.

                  <p>It was the good Aſſertion of one of her Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Viſitors, <hi>That he never heard her ſpeak any thing untheological; and that, though ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to nothing of Inſpiration, nor any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, but what was the Effect of her Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diligence; yet whatſoever Diſcourſe did

                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49718:43"/>Thus we are come to <hi>Martha Taylors</hi> caſe, which was beyond controverſie a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſcovery of the Care and Providence of God; whence you may read the ground of my firſt thoughts, <hi>That the Care and Providence of God hath not done with the world.</hi> All that have ſeen her, or heard her ſtory, have preſently ſet the Crown upon the Head of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I ſhall here cloſe up this with a word of Apology, for the length of this Conſectary, and an engagement to greater brevity in thoſe that follow.</p>
                  <p>Some father every thing upon Providence, others nothing, or the next to nothing. Some are ready to refuge themſelves in it, as if it were a proper <hi>Aſylum</hi> for their Enormities; others ſteal all away from it, and offer it up at the Shrine of Fate, the ſtarry Influence, or any thing before they will come to the <hi>Door of God.</hi> As there is no need for us to look over, or deny ſecond cauſes (eſpecially) in natural actions, for this would be preſumption and a tempting of God: So there is no need of tying God to give always attendance to <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method, degree, or way of managing them; <hi>He is a moſt free, wiſe, and powerful Agent;</hi> whatſoever he uſeth (as was ſaid before) is not upon the account of his own weakneſs, but upon the acount of his own will, which is ſacred and not to be diſputed.</p>

I dare not put Nature up into the Throne with God, as the ſmooth Poet ſeems to do, ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rude and formeleſs <hi>Chaos,</hi> where the ſeeds of things ſeemed to the eye of ſenſe to be jumbled up together in an undigeſted Lump or <hi>Embrio,</hi> where he ſaith (<hi>Metamorph. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>fab.</hi> 1.)

                  </p>
                  <p>For I know nature to be <hi>Gods ſervant,</hi> and that it carries on his deſigns, and is actuated by his Providence; this is it which directeth the operations of all individuals and ſingle Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences.</p>
                  <p>There are many Relations in Sacred Hiſtory, not carried beyond the bounds of Providence in the uſe of means, that are ſo full of Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths and various turnings, that they were able to convert a Stoick.
